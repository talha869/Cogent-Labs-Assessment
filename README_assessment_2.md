# Text Processing and Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to processing and analyzing text data. It covers the steps from loading text from PDF files to preprocessing the text for further analysis.

## Features
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Demonstrates how to extract text from PDF files using PyMuPDF.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Offers a method to clean and preprocess text data for analysis.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Shows how to set up and use the OpenAI API for potential language model interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `openai`, `langchain`, `fpdf`, `PyMuPDF (fitz)`
- An active OpenAI API key set as an environment variable.

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create a requirements file as necessary).
2. Replace the placeholder OpenAI API key with your own.
3. Modify the PDF file path to the document you wish to analyze.
